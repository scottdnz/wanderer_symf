  -if strength higher, more chance to hit with HTH attack
    e.g. PC 30, enemy 15
    30 - 15 = +15 to hit
  -if strength higher, +1 damage for every 5 points higher
    e.g. PC 30, enemy 15
    15 strength diff / 5 = +3 damage
    
  -if constitution higher, resists damage
    e.g PC 30, -1 damage for every 3 con
    --> -10 damage
  
  -if dexterity higher, more chance of evading attack (less chance for enemy to hit)
    e.g. PC 30, enemy 15
    --> -15 chance to hit
  -if dexterity higher, more chance of hitting with ranged attack
    +1 to hit for every 3 dex, e.g.
    30 dex --> +10 to hit

    -armour class defence (block)
    -dex defence bonus (evade)

  *Damage

Text parser - going to be biggest issue
mostly in PHP
JS only checks if blank, not a valid command found
Need to eliminate "inbetween" words, e.g. to, the
some words needed: in, on, into, through

**Valid commands:
Each of these will need a hook
*look / examine
  -on its own, refresh and display location description
  -with a noun, act on it (e.g. look map, see item description)
*read (book / scroll / sign)
  -display message attached to object/item
inventory
open container with item
close
take / get
give
go / walk
climb
attack
*drop
-remove item/weapon/armour id from PC
talk / say / speak
throw
jump

Directions:
0 = no exit
1 = exit
2 = locked/barred/obstacle
exit_n
exit_ne 
exit_e 
exit_se 
exit_s
exit_sw
exit_w 
exit_nw 
exit_up 
exit_down 
storey_val  //0 = underground, 1 = ground level, 2 = second storey


Need some kind of hook for every time something is typed, e.g. 
go into a location
action, e.g. use key to open door
-> trigger a response

    
**Notes from ex book:
*DB stores location in grid, 20 * 20 = 400
-write a grid creator script / a GUI tool to help do it?
each location assigned a matrix no. by y,x e.g. 

0,0   0,1   0,2   0,3

1,0   1,1   1,2   1,3

2,0   2,1   2,2   2,3

Only some locations possible to be moved to from each location. Max: 4?
"n"
"ne"
"e"
"se"
"s"
"sw"
"w"
"nw"
"up"
"down"
e.g. strings like:
"n ne e s"
"n"
"n ne"
"n ne e"

Calculations for direction:
to go north, y - 1
to go ne, y - 1 and x + 1
to go e, x + 1
to go se, y + 1 and x + 1
to go s, y + 1
to go sw, y + 1 and x - 1
to go w, x - 1
to go nw, y - 1 and x - 1

Each loc'n has a:
description
image(s) - image name
enemies? - in own table
non-takeable objects, e.g. tree, door
takeable items? regular / weapons
NPC(s)?

for each location, hooks:
  -time increments by 3 minutes
  -check which items are in the location
  -check which players are in the location
  (-check the special feature in the location, and its state (if item has location_effect id that matches location, using it will do something to feature))
  -check which players are following the main player, and move them to current location
  -if are enemies with hostile mood in location, attack all players in location


NPCs - are in a fixed location or moving
-have their own health, stats
-can follow the character around
-why would one stop following?
-have things to say
-script trees attached to them? an event can trigger a dialogue section

Dialogue
scripted events?
weather changes? random?
time? progresses by 5 mins? -need a wait command?


Ideas - troll bridge
sphinx with riddles

**Inventory for a character:
Regular items
Weapons items
Armour items
Magic items


**Items / objects
All have a location in the grid (when not picked up)

Need Inventory screen
-switch between characters
-filter by regular / armour / weapon / magic item
-can equip, unequip or drop 




*Objects 
-not takeable
-often a feature of a room that is actionable, e.g. door, window, chest, boulder

*Regular items
- food, drink, utility (rope, key, map, candle, lantern, tinderbox)
takeable, openable, breakable, get used up?
-some have effect only at a certain place when used
